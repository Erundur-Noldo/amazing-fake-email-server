I have a weird worldbuilding project in my mind, which I want to present as a series of emails between the characters. Sending actual emails is too much of a bother, and making textfiles by hand... no.
so I made this :3
the basic functionality is there, I guess
note that you have to define every user by changing the source code, which is fine for my purposes because there is a very much finite, even in practice, number of characters in this world
as in.. on Earth, the number is finite, technically, but *practically* it's infinite, right??
here it's not.
so ye :3
enjoy if you care about this ^>^
